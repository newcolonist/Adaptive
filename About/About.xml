Adaptive Threats is the 1.1 - 1.2 version of Adaptive Cassie Storyteller. It applies on top of the storyteller. This version takes into account the body size of your colonists (i.e. a proxy for age in mods with children, or vanilla teens).

The storyteller determines the pace of the threats (phoebe - chill, cassandra - steady, randy - random) and this mod rebalances the threat scale based on the story relevance of your colonists (a hidden game stat), much less on wealth.

There are three difficulty levels, Default (recommended), Chill and Hardcore. The differences will build up over time depending on the fate of your colonists.

It changes the curve of the threats, whereas the 1.2 vanilla custom difficulty is based on static parameters, which makes this mod still relevant in a custom difficulty.
