Adaptive Threats changes the curve of the threat scale which is a static parameter. It will be more progressive at start, but uncapped in the end-game.

It is based on the story relevance of your colonists (a hidden game stat), much less on wealth. For the 1.3 version, since the story relevance is no longer a thing, a proxy has been used.

There are three difficulty levels, Default (recommended), Chill and Hardcore. The differences will build up over time depending on the fate of your colonists. Since the start is much more progressive, the base difficulty (threat scale) should be set relatively high, above 155% or "blood and dust", and a cheese free playstyle should be sustainable much longer.

It doesn't change anything else in a standard or custom scenario.
